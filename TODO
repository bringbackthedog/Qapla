[x] ioexpr might have to be a statement. Since it will always be on its own..
   statement --> ioexpr ';'
    
[x] Print might have to be a statemnt; Expressions dont evaluate; 
      ie: print( 3 + 4 ) doesnt work as the + operator doesnt get evaluated
      x = 3 + 4 ; print ( x ) ;  <- doesnt work

[ ] Need to add EXIT of scope; Cureently there is only increase of scope, not decrease

[ ] Make a list of unusable keywords; ie: cannot use 'print' outside of the specific print context


[ ] FUNC p ( w ) {  } <-- doesnt work (syntax error) 
      - Just need to add grammar rule for no statements (fundecl) 

________________________________________________________

NOTE: removed   ~RULE~:statements --> /*empty*/  .. honestly not sure if that broke anything

FUNC p ( a : b : c ) { VAR x ; VAR y ; VAR z ;  z = 3 ; print ( z ) ; }  <-- print z gets evaluated BEFORE funcall!
p ( 9 : 8 : 7 ) ;
print ( c ) ;

FUNC p ( a : b : c ) { VAR x ; VAR y ; VAR z ;  z = 3 ; }   <-- WORKS ! 
p ( 9 : 8 : 7 ) ;
print ( c ) ;
