README: CSCI 330 Project 2020

Lenz Thierry Paul

Unfortunately, due to time and personal concerns related to the current
pandemic, I haven't been able to complete this project to the extent that 
I wanted to. Nonetheless, it remains a first attempt at developing a language
of which I am proud.

==============================================================================

Program 
--------------------
This is an interactive interpreter for the fooish language.
To exit the interpreter, type: exit


INSTALLATION
--------------------
- run makefile, located in src/ 
- execute program by running fooChecker 
- the grammar is detailed in y.output (auto generated) 

[optional] 
   I've added the following files for different levels of debugging and
   informative messages. 

   - fooCheckerd
   - fooChecker_debug
   - fooChecker_debug_full
