README: CSCI 330 Project 2020

Currently the repository contains this README,
   a makefile to build fooChecker and fooCheckerd,
   a sample/starter fooChecker.lex and fooChecker.yacc,
   a sample input file valid/t0 that passes the initial fooChecker,
   a sample input file invalid/e0 that fails on the initial fooChecker

To build fooChecker simply run the command 'make',
   to use it to check the validity of sample foo files use
      ./fooChecker < filename
   e.g.  ./fooChecker < valid/t0
         ./fooChecker < invalid/e0

Details on the project requirements and language specification
   can be found at:

A careful description of what you did/did not get working for
your fooChecker should be inserted here.
